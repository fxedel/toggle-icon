toggle-icon
=================

## What does this element?
`toggle-icon` is a custom element created with Polymer. It provides an extremly powerful and customizable switch that looks like a `paper-icon-button`. Use `toggleIcon.checked` to get the toggle-icon's status in JavaScript. For more information about the usage, see the [component page](http://fxedel.github.io/toggle-icon/).

Here's a gif that shows five icon-toggle elements which are toggled by setting the `checked` property programmatically:
